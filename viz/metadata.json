Change 2020-10-29: The growth parameter can be thought of as the transmissibility of the virus in that state on that date and is a weighted regression between the  trend in the growth rate over the past 42 days and a growth rate that would keep the number of new daily confirmed cases constant. The weights of these two components are dynamically tuned to the observed data. To model new deaths in the population, we assume that a fraction of the 1,2,3,4, or 5-week moving average of the daily confirmed cases will die. The model learns both the moving average window and the case fatality fraction that best fits the historical observations."

For an initial, unobserved, seeding time infections were estimated using an exponential model with priors based on observed growth. For each subsequent time step, previous imputed infections were summed, weighted by an uncertain generation time probability mass function, and combined with an estimate of Rt to give the incidence at that time. The infection trajectories were then mapped to mean reported case counts by convolving over an uncertain incubation period and report delay distribution. Observed reported case counts were then assumed to be generated from a negative binomial observation model with overdispersion, multiplied by a day of the week effect with an independent parameter for each day of the week. Temporal variation was controlled using an approximate Gaussian process with a Matern 3/2 kernel. Rt was assumed to be constant over the forecast horizon although a correction was applied to adjust for the time-varying proportion of the population that was susceptible. Deaths were then modelled as a convolution of forecast cases combined with some scaling factor, a day of the week effect and a negative binomial observation model.",

We then estimate parameters by a knowledge synthesis process considering parameter ranges derived from external studies and public data.

It estimates moving ascertainment rate using data of hospitalized subjects (using a proportion of cases not caught before admission to hospital), so it estimates not only the observed part of the epidemic (compartment I) but also the undetected absent infected (compartment A). The model incorporates transmission rate estimate dependence on mobility data and optimizes affected clusters' size to estimate all exposed individuals using the moving ascertainment rate estimate. To model deaths, we incorporated fixed time delay from positivity report to death estimated from data. Currently, we assume around 0.44% IFR, a simple division of the age structure 65+/65- is used. The model estimates continuously from the first outbreak (spring 2020), the prevalence corresponds to the Czech prevalence study from May 2020 as well as to December community test screenings. We incorporated dominance of b.1.1.7 at the beginning of the year 2021 by multiplying the transmission rate by 1.5 (the estimate is based on data that reveal evidence on its dependence on the number of risk contacts - study PAQ research https://zivotbehempandemie.cz/kontakty or mobility data). With the dominance of b.1.1.7 we increased the probability of hospitalization by factor 1.3 and the conditional probability of death in case of hospitalization by factor 1.1. We submit a single calibration to forecast deaths and cases while the prediction intervals are estimated using time series decomposition. Especially, we subtract a deterministic trend given by the SEIAR model."

The posterior distribution of model parameters and the transition matrices are estimated by an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that also provides predictions and allows us to compute the reproduction number Rt.

The total execution time for 184 countries is 11.83s and for more than 3000 US counties is 101.03s.
