methods_long: "Fraunhofer-ITWM's predictions are based on a cohort model that groups
people according to four age groups and according to the status
infected, detected and successfully vaccinated. The dynamics of the
epidemic are described by integral equations. In particular, we assume
an infectious period with fixed onset, end and infectivity. The most
important parameters are contact rates between age groups, detection
rates and times, and death rates and times. They are adjusted to the
historical data of the RKI. For forecasts, the simulation is continued
with the parameters determined for the last week. In principle, the
forecast quality could still be improved by anticipating the effects
of events such as the end of public holidays on contact and detection
rates. However, this is not yet done in the automatic submissions.
All calculations use automatic differentiation. This speeds up
parameter adjustment and allows for error estimates. The latter are
determined by comparing counted and simulated cases and by matching
the empirical standard deviations with the standard deviations
predicted by the calculated sensitivities. The model is described in
detail in
