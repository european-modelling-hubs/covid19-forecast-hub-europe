team_model_designation: primary
methods: A single autoregressive model fit jointly to all European time series, adding time series from the top regions across the world. A high-dimensional manifold embedding is used capture the process.

data_inputs: JHU (reported fatalities)

methods_long: "The information of multiple time series can be shared in a single model via a large dimensional manifold embedding.\
 \ In addition to Europe death series, the regions with the largest average daily deaths are added to reduce the variance \
 \ of the model estimation and share information (the regions more advanced in the pandemic can help forecast the others).\
 \ Each time series is time-delay embedded and stacked together before for fitting a single linear autoregressive model.\
 \ The dimension of the embedding is tuned by temporal validation, the best dimension of the last 4 weeks.\
 \ This methodology has been successfully applied in the ensemble forecast efforts of Spain and Australia. \
 \ See citation for detailed description and statistical properties."
