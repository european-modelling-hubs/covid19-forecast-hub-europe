methods_long: "The main idea behind our agent-based model is a representation of the social structure of population of Poland to the level of individual citizen and its social contacts. Our model has resolution in space and contexts. It means it can follow development of epidemic on geographical grid in 1km resolution as well as through physical contact in various characteristic contexts of social life."
