methods_long: "An extended SEIR model with additional compartments for undetected cases is fit
  \  using multiple segments to the available data for reported cases and then to reported \
  \ deaths. The parametrization of the last fit is used to forecast incidental and cumulative \
  \ deaths. Confidence intervals are determined using Monte Carlo sampling of the parameter space."
