methods_long: "Forecasts from experts and non-experts are elicited using a shinyApp. \
  \ Two variants of this shiynApp exist. In one, forecasters are asked to predict \
  \ cases and deaths directly. In the other, forecasters are asked to predict Rt. \
  \ The Rt predictions are then mapped to death and cases using a renewal equation \
  \ and the R package EpiNow2. \
  \ Individuals currently make forecasts by choosing a distribution and specifying the \
  \ median and width of that predictive distribution for evey forecast horizon. \
  \ Forecasts from both apps are collected and a mean ensemble is formed."
