methods_long: Forecasts are based on TBATS - models (DeLivera, Hyndman und Snyder (2011)) and are updated daily for each German state. Final models are based on comparing multiple models and selecting the best-performing model based on AIC in historical data. The models forecast 7-day incidence and we convert forecasts back into number of daily new cases. The forecasting model is the same that is used at our website below.
