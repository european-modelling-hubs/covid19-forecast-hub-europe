methods_long: "This model simulates SIR-dynamics with a log-normal convolutions \
 \ of infections to obtain the delayed reported cases. Parameters of the model are \
 \ sampled with Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo using the PyMC3 Python library. We assume that \
 \ the infection rate can change every week, with a standard deviation that is also an \ 
 \ optimized parameter. When new governmental restrictions are enacted or lifted, we \ 
 \ include a small prior to the change of the infection rate."
